# Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System for Delhi Transport Corporation

## Overview

The **Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System** is designed to streamline and automate the scheduling and route planning process for the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). This project aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the reliability of bus services by replacing the current manual methods with an automated software solution. The system leverages algorithms, data analytics, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to manage both linked and unlinked duty scheduling and optimize route planning.

## Features

### 1. Linked Duty Scheduling
- Assign a specific crew to a bus at the start of their duty, ensuring they remain with the bus throughout their shift.
- Manage and monitor crew and bus assignments, fostering better familiarity and accountability.

### 2. Unlinked Duty Scheduling
- Allow crews to hand over buses to other crew members after completing their assigned trips.
- Manage rest periods for crew members and reassign them to different buses after their rest period.

### 3. Route Management
- Map all existing routes and provide a visual representation of the entire bus network.
- Enable users to draw new routes and automatically highlight overlaps with existing routes.
- Optimize route planning to reduce congestion and improve service coverage.

## Expected Output

The project aims to develop a fully functional prototype of the Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System. The prototype will demonstrate the following capabilities:
- Automation of bus scheduling processes.
- Efficient management of crew and bus assignments.
- Optimization of route planning using GIS technologies.
- User-friendly interface for schedulers, planners, and managers to interact with the system, manage schedules, plan routes, and access real-time data and reports.
